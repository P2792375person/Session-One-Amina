<!--I had the same structure for the contact html page just without the photos.I made a "div" and added a "style" next to this. I could have done this in
css but this is easier since its only one style attribute added. Intially Within the "div" I added two other "divs " and made this into a class called "captions" and "instagramname".
 This is about the two captions that I want on the left handside of the page. I did this because i want to style my captions in "css" code and I can position them in here aswell.Also
 I put the "<strong>" tag inbetween my instagram name because I wanted it bold. Instead I made my instgram logo a "clickable" link to my instagram account. After that I made this caption into a "class" named "instagramcaption." For
some reason I could not style this class in css code. then i realised that the issue was that i had my caption in the anchor element so it still thinks its a link -->
