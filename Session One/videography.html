<!--I had the same structure for the Index html page just without the photos. I made a "div" and added the video tag "<video>." To move the menu down i used the break tag "br."
Then i added the "<video controls>" so my video could be played. After that i added the "style" attribute to this tag so I could resize my video becvause this is
just easier than making a class just to resize one thing. Then i used the "<source>" tag and "src" and "type = " to input my video in the right format onto my web page. After that
I created a class called "captionvid" in here I had the same settings as my index caption but its different heights because of the conent above it is not the exact same.-->
